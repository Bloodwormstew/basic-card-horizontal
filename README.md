## Documentation for Aiden's Business Card

This is the first website ive made from scratch, or almost scratch (not using google sites). This was for a project for my web typography class at Umass Dartmouth. We were tasked to make a virtual buisness card for ourselves. I had used one of the template that our professor had provided us with. As a dark artist i wanted to make my site ad disturbing and unfreindly as possible. At first I wanted to have two ripped out eyeballs, one on each side whos pupils would follow the cusor but ultimently decided against it due to my lack of coding knowlage and the worry that it would look too busy. Originally the idea for this page would have looked drastically different, but I had managed to keep some of my ideas intact such as the gnashing teeth, blood, and dark web horror vibe. it was heavily inspired by the artistic directions that the videogame "Welcome to the Game" portrays the darkweb. I knew I wanted something disturbing to set the mood for my buisness card as making people feel uncomfortable through my art is what I do. Overall I can honestly say I'm pretty happy with the way this project turned out.
