## Documentation for Business Card

I had originally wanted to have two ripped out eyeballs, one on each side whos pupils would follow the cusor but ultimently decided against it due to my lack of coding knowlage and the worry that it would look too busy. Originally the idea for this page would have looked drastically different, but I had managed to keep some of my ideas intact such as the gnashing teeth, blood, and dark web horror vibe. it was heavily inspired by the artistic directions that the videogame "Welcome to the Game" portrays the darkweb. I knew i wanted something disturbing to set the mood for my buisness card as I am an artist who loves making people feel uncomfortable.
